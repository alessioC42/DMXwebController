# DMXwebController
<b>STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</b>

<a href="https://alessioc42.github.io/DMXwebController/site/">TEST UI</a>

A simple web environment to simulate a lighting console and connect it to a Thinkerforge DMX Bricklet interface. Suitable for low end use. (theaters without special effects, speakers, ...) The software is mainly desinged for my school lightning system, which does not offer some fancy RGB-lights etc. Therefore this system only supports 24 channels. The goal is to create a easy to understand UI for non teckies. <i>(future project: make it scalable to use all 512 Channels)</i>
